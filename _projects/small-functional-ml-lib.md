The [idea behind word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics#Distributional_hypothesis) - words that occur in the same neighbourhood are similar in meaning or context - can be extended to associative networks as well. Suitably parameterized random walks can help discover a highly representative neighbourhood or context for a node. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/razered/core2vec)

something along the lines of Joel Grus maybe? Or Hasktorch or Autograd or something?
