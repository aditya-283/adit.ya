Pre-trained convnets can be used as fixed feature extractors - detecting edges and shapes in the image. This is more efficient than starting from a clean slate because we don't have to reinvent the wheel. ResNets trained on the ImageNet database are a superb example of this idea - I use them to achieve very high accuracy on a small, difficult dataset.
