jQuery.nonSuckyYouTubeEmbed is a jQuery plugin designed to improve front end performance when working with YouTube embeds.

The plugin works by fetching the fetching a thumbnail image and overlaying a play button, and replacing the thumbnail with the embedded YouTube iFrame when only when the user clicks the play button. This is important *always* but especially important for sites the embed multiple videos on a single page.

I also took a deep dive on YouTube embeds in [this blog post]({{site.url}}/blog/non-sucky-youtube-embed).
