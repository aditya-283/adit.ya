The idea behind word2vec - the Distributional Hypothesis - words that occur in the same neighbourhood are similar in meaning or context can be extended to associative networks as well. What remains is coming up with the correct notion of a neighbourhood for a network. Suitably parameterized random walks can help discover a highly representative neighbourhood for a node.
