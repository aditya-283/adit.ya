    <br>If so, please consider checking out my side project <a href="https://domainclamp.com">Domain Clamp</a>. It's a SaaS which monitors domains and SSL certificates and sends notifications before anything expires. If you work at an agency, then you're probably not the registrant for your client's domains or the SSL certificate owner. This means you won't get expiration notifications. You don't want a client's domain or SSL certificate to expire under your watch. Believe me, I've been there.<br>
    <br><a href="https://domainclamp.com">Domain Clamp</a> solves this problem by letting you monitor the SSL certificate and registration for any domain you'd damn please. Free accounts are available so please <a href="https://domainclamp.com">head on over &raquo;</a></p>
