<p>I love challenging myself by reading fascinating computer science theory and using insights contained therein to try to become a better programmer.</p>
<p>Join me as I explore functional programming and type theory and neural networks and appreciate elegant math and code along the way. </p>
<p>Some of these explorations become <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, others are published as <a href="/blog/">articles or tutorials</a>. I also maintain a list of <a href="/favourites">bookmarks</a> for things I'm reading or thinking about.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, the best way is <a href="mailto:bhagwat.work@gmail.com">via email</a>.</p>
