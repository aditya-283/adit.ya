<p>I love fiddling with large neural networks and trying to get them to "understand" human language. I document my <a href="/projects">efforts</a> and <a href="/blogs/">learnings</a> here.</p>
<p>I'm a Pythonista slowly falling in love with Haskell and Typescript.</p>
<p>I studied Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur and am an incoming graduate student of Machine Learning at CMU if COVID subsides by August next year.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me the best way is <a href="mailto:bhagwat.work@gmail.com">through email</a>. Let me know if I made a mistake anywhere or if you have an interesting idea you would like to see a post about.</p>
