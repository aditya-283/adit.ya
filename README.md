## Know me!

I blog about the things I am learning and maintain a portfolio of my projects on this website.

Tell me what you like and don't like about my website by <a class="inline-link" href=mailto:bhagwat.work@gmail.com> mailing me</a>

Created using Jekyll and hosted on Render for free! 

:bulb: **Tip** : If you want to get something up and ready quickly to showcase skills to an employer - start from someone else's open source website and modify it to your taste. 
I started with [this](https://maxchadwick.xyz/) source, simplified parts of it and added some other features.
